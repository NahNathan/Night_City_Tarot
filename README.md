Night City Tarot is a random image generator designed specifically for the Cyberpunk Red tabletop RPG, utilizing the additional content Night City Tarot. This tool adds an element of chaos and unpredictability to your gaming sessions with themed tarot cards.


## Usage

Using Night City Tarot is straightforward and enhances your Cyberpunk Red gameplay with the following steps:

3. **Follow the Rules**:
   - Whenever three or more dice rolled for damage from a Melee or Ranged Attack come up as 6, draw a card using the Night City Tarot application.
   - Apply the effects of the drawn card as listed in the application instead of using a typical Critical Injury.
   - Only draw a card if the attack is against a single target and if both the attacker and defender are capable of sustaining Critical Injuries (e.g., not a drone).

4. **Single Card Per Session**:
   - After drawing and resolving a card, put the card effect away. Only one card can be pulled from the Night City Tarot per game session.
